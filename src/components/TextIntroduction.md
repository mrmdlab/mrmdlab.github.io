Specializing in rodent MRI and MRS, we delve into both structural and functional aspects of the brain and various organs. Primarily focusing on rodent models, we excel in conducting brain structural scans, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for both mice and rats. Beyond the brain, our expertise extends to conducting structural scans of vital organs such as the liver and heart. This versatility allows us to explore a wide range of research questions related to neurobiology, physiology, and beyond.
